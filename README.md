# profitabe-app-ideas
Jupyter Notebook Project reviewing data from Google Play and Apple App Store to identify an idea for app dev

What App to Build?
Free Download Ad-Supported App
This project is intended to identify a profile to be used for developing an ad-supported and free to install application. We will be looking at data provided by the Apple App Store and the Google Play App Store. Using these two data sets we'll attempt to understand the type of app we should develop. In addition to being a free app this app will need to be English speaking. Our goal is to make ad-revenue from our app. As a result, it is critical to find apps who attract a large number of users and a large number of repeat or daily active users.
